    "## Prerequisite : modifying a table or a column, with `ALTER TABLE`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a table is created, you may sometimes need to modify it, by changing its name, or the name of a column, adding a column or deleting one. (Again : remember CRUD).\n",
    "\n",
    "For these operations we have the `ALTER TABLE` command which is very intuitive to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the `ALTER TABLE` commands has not always been fully implemented in SQLite. Pay attention to notes below.\n",
    "\n",
    "First note : it is always wise to create a backup of your database before any attempt to make significant changes to its schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying a table : change name\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the name of a table, the syntax is very simple : \n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "ALTER TABLE <old_table_name> \n",
    "    RENAME TO <new_table_name>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying a table : add a column\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a column, the command is also very clear and simple :\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "ALTER TABLE <table_name> \n",
    "    ADD COLUMN <new_column_name>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you can add constraints when you create a new column. But when you add a column to a table, some constraints can’t be specified :\n",
    "\n",
    "- of course the new column can’t be a `PRIMARY KEY`\n",
    "- it can’t be `UNIQUE` (as it is empty at its creation and records already exist  : )\n",
    "- it can’t have the default values : `CURRENT_TIME`, `CURRENT_DATE` or `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` (as some records already exist : they can’t have current datetime value)\n",
    "- there are also limitations on other constraints, but they are based on more elaborate notions that we have not seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying a table/column : drop a column\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply :\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "ALTER TABLE <table_name> \n",
    "    DROP COLUMN <column_name>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- you cannot drop a column if it is a `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE`\n",
    "- you also cannot delete a column if it is referenced elsewhere in the schema (see `FOREIGN KEY` constraints below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention ! This syntax is valid only for SQLite > v3.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Old method (with previous versions) : \n",
    "1. create new table as the one you are trying to change,\n",
    "2. copy all data,\n",
    "3. drop old table,\n",
    "4. rename the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the `DROP COLUMN` command do? It actually does the exact steps above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying a table/column : change name\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is clear, again :\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "ALTER TABLE <table_name> \n",
    "    RENAME COLUMN <old_name> \n",
    "        TO <new_name>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing a column type\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no standard SQL syntax to do this : each DBMS will have its particularity\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is especially tricky. As SQLite has weakly types, the best (simpler) move is to :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a table to the table with the new datatype (you know how to code this!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Copy the old column by casting the data to the new type :\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "UPDATE <table_name> \n",
    "       SET <new_column_name> = CAST(<old_column_name> as <new_data_type>)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, canonical (and sure) but more complex method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new table with the same columns, except the one we want to modify, which will have the type we want\n",
    "2. Copy the old table data into the new table the column we want to modify)\n",
    "3. Drop the old table\n",
    "4. Rename the new table with the name of the old table\n",
    "5. Commit !\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise : try to implement this sequence with a table you used. For example cast an `INTEGER` column to `TEXT`.\n",
    "\n"

    "## Foreign key constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that when creating tables, we can declare a column as `PRIMARY KEY`.\n",
    "When we have created ERD, we have seen that we can declare references between tables, connecting PK and FK.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we can declare FK in the database schema. It adds constraints : if, when creating a table, we declare a FK and a relationship with another table, this new table cannot be dropped or modified as easily, to preserve the structure of the database or schema. It makes life harder for the data scientist or administrator, but it secures the data. That’s the advantage of the relational model and to store data in databases (rather than in flatfiles).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we declare a FK ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are creating to tables : `students` and `cursus` :\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "CREATE TABLE cursus(\n",
    "    code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "    name TEXT,\n",

    "    firstname TEXT, \n",
    "    lastname TEXT,\n",
    "    cursus_id INTEGER     -- This column will refer to a cursus.code\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The declaration of a FK is a bit more complicated than the declaration of a PK :\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "CREATE TABLE cursus(\n",
    "    code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "    name TEXT,\n",
    "    major TEXT,\n",
    "    referent TEXT\n",

    "CREATE TABLE students(\n",
    "    id INTEGER,\n",
    "    firstname TEXT, \n",
    "    lastname TEXT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY(cursus_id) REFERENCES cursus(code) INTEGER     -- This column will refer to a cursus.id\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite will then forbids :\n",
    "\n",
    "- to delete a records in cursus if at least one students record references to it\n",
    "- to record a student (insert) who would not refer to a cursus\n",
    "- only a `NULL` value of students.cursus_id would not raise an error\n",
    "- it is allowed to specify a `NOT NULL` constraint to a `FOREIGN KEY` : by doing so we define a very strict relationship between the tables (each student recorded in the table `students` must refer to a cursus). \n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, this foreign key constraint forbids the modification or suppression of the table to which the FK refers. But sometimes we need to modify or drop/delete tables or columns of such table. We can temporarily disable those constraint with a `PRAGMA` clause : \n",
    "\n",
