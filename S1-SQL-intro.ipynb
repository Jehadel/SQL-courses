It is often the most time consuming stage of a data science project, but necessary to improve the understanding and the quality of the dataset. Python provide powerful tools for this, such as `numpy`, `pandas` (`geopandas`), `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `plotly` libraries.

Each record is unique and identfied by a **primary key** which is one attribute wich takes a different value for each record. Chosing a primary key is mandatory. Sometime several attributes meet the uniqueness condition, they are called **candidate keys**, the primary key, and only one primary key, is chosen among them.\n",

    "SQlite is a software component which can be used as a minimalist DBMS and perfect to learn how to write SQL requests. If you want to interact with db engines build upon a client-server architecture, you should turn toward `sqlalchemy` for exemple. With SQLite you don’t need to add any third component, which is great for a course to non experts in computer science. It is perfect for learning purpose, prototyping or development of local or embedded applications. In this course we will use the `sqlite3` library, wich belongs to the standard distribution of Python.\n",
